# The skeleton of a visualization library

## What this is
A crowd-sourced catalog of existing, static data visualizations and the code used to implement them that programmers can add to and reference to learn from each other

## Requirements
* Must support uploading code formatted by language [R, python, SAS, and Stata]
* Must support uploading images
* Must be easy to contribute (assuming knowledge of git)
* Must be available to internal staff

## What this (currently) isn't
* A "plug-and-play" catalog of standardized visualization templates that can be used across languages and projects
* A catalog of hosted interactive visualizatons
* A tool that allows the user to upload their own data

## Potential enhancements

* Filter by specific language
* Include links to visualizations that exist in a public-facing product

## Known bugs

* Viewing window for code is too small - resize so that user does not need to scroll
* Only include visualizations with MPR colors
